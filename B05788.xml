            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Between this and the <hi>Long-ſand,</hi> is a Channel near two miles broad, where there is twelve and thirteen fathom: from the South-weſt and North-eaſt end of this ſhoal, runs a Ridge more then a mile to the North-eaſt and South-weſt, on which there is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 fathom; and off either ſide more water. South by Eaſt from the <hi>Long-ſand-head,</hi> you will go to the eaſtwards of this ſhoal. To the E. S. E. of this, you will quickly come in 15, 17, 19, and 20 fathom water.
<note place="margin">Bearings of the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh-Knock</note> The body of this <hi>Knock</hi> lies from <hi>St. Peters</hi> Church (on the <hi>North-Foreland</hi>) N. N.

<note place="margin">A Note to know the Knock from the Long-ſand</note> To know when you are near the <hi>Knock</hi> or <hi>Long-ſand-head,</hi> is thus, When you are near the <hi>Knock,</hi> you ſhall ſee the Land of the <hi>North-Foreland</hi> very plain; but when you are at the <hi>Long-ſand-head,</hi> you will hardly ſee the Land, except it be very clear weather, or unleſs you go up the ſhrouds.

                  <p>If you will go into <hi>Humber,</hi> coming from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, be ſure to keep ſo far off the <hi>Spurn</hi> ſhore, as that you may be in ſix or ſeven fathom water, and that depth will lead you without the Stone-bank, that lies a great diſtance from the Land; and when you are ſo far that you have brought <hi>Patrington</hi> Church up to the <hi>Spurn,</hi> then muſt you bear in Weſt, and Weſt by North, and W.N.W. This Church ſtandeth up in the Bay to the N. N. W. of the <hi>Spurn,</hi> having a high Spire Steeple; being within the <hi>Spurn,</hi> you may edge into the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ride very well with a North-eaſt, or E.N.E. Wind; or ſteer Weſt by North towards the <hi>buoy</hi> of the Sand called the <hi>Bull,</hi> in ſeven or eight fathom water:
<note place="margin">Bull.</note> The thwart marks of the ſaid <hi>buoy,</hi> is a Houſe upon the Weſt end of the Cliff of <hi>Clayneſs,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Grimsby</hi>-Road, and anchor a little below the Beacon.

                  <p>The Town of <hi>Shorum</hi> lyeth almoſt a mile within the Haven; Veſſels that draw but eight or nine foot, can lie afloat a little below the Town at low-water; or elſe they lie dry every where, when you come from the Eaſtwards from <hi>Beachy</hi> or <hi>New-Haven;</hi> alongſt by the Shore, you may ſee open into the Haven before you come thwart of it; but coming from the weſtwards, you ſhall not ſee it open, before you come right againſt it, becauſe the Weſt Point lyeth ſomewhat farther out than the Eaſt Point: from the Weſt Point runneth off a little tayl; but at high-water you may run in alongſt over it, otherwiſe you muſt run in by the Eaſt Shore: upon the Eaſt Point ſtand two Beacons, which you muſt bring one in the other, and ſo run in right with them, until you come by the North Shore, and then in alongſt by it.</p>

                  <p>There is likewiſe a Channel between the <hi>Brambles</hi> and the Main for ſmall Ships, but there is not above ten foot at low-water.</p>

                     <hi>Silly</hi> is divided into divers Iſland; alongſt the Weſt ſide lyeth a great multitude of Rocks; you may go in there through divers Channels or Sounds, but the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt,
<note place="margin">St. Maries-Sound.</note> called St. <hi>Maries-ſound,</hi> is the beſt, being a fair opening of a Channel, but near the midſt lie two ſunken Rocks; in ſoul weather you may ſee the Sea break over them; it is beſt to leave them on the Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board-ſide going in, and on the Starboard-ſide coming out, and go ſo near the Starboard-ſhore, as that you may but ſee the Wind-mill-Sweeps which ſtandeth on the Hill, or that you may almoſt throw a Stone aſhore; and when you come within the Point, luff up round, and come to anchor in ſight of the Houſes; or when you have brought the Town open of the Valley, leave two thirds of the Harbour on your Larboard-ſide.</p>
                  <p>Thwart of <hi>Smiths-Iſland</hi> lyeth a Ledge of Rocks, called <hi>Bartholomen-Ledge;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Ledge of Rocks.</note> when you come to the Block-houſe that ſtandeth on the Water-ſide, a Cables length off the Shore, thwart lyeth a ſunken Rock, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Woolman:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Woolman.</note> The leading Mark to go clear of it, is two Rocks which lie on the Weſt ſide within the Haven; the one (to wit, the innermoſt) is ſomewhat greater than the other; if you bring them one in the other, or the northermoſt a little open to the eaſtward of the other, ſo as that you may ſee between them; keeping them ſo, ſayl right in, then you need not fear the <hi>Woolman;</hi> Remember that you ride not too near the Iſland, for it is all foul ground; but upon <hi>Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> and between that and the northermoſt Rock, is clear ground; then the Point of St. <hi>Maries</hi> will bear from you E. S. E. and the Broad-Sound will be open from the South-weſt by Weſt, to the Weſt by South; but if you will ride near the North-Rock, you ſhall have it but two Points open, &amp; St. <hi>Maries</hi> Sound cloſe; but then you ſhall not get out of St. <hi>Maries</hi> Sound if the Wind blow at South-weſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Smiths</hi>-Sound is very dangerous, except a man be forced to it, I would adviſe him not to make uſe of the Channel; there is water enough, but it is very narrow, keep therefore in the middle of it; it lyeth North-weſt.

                  <p>If you be ſure by your reckoning, height, and depth that you are entred into the Channel to the eaſtward of the <hi>Lizard,</hi> be not fearful, but bear over to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Shore, ſo that the Wind be at S. S. W. or South by Weſt, until you come to 45 or 46 fathom; then ſteer away E.N.E. and Eaſt by North, and ſteering ſo, and keeping your Lead; when you come to be thwart of the <hi>Start,</hi> you ſhall have 44 or 43 fathom, and fine white Sand, then are you between 4 and 5 leagues from the Shore: but to be the more certain where you are, when you come to this white Sand, ſteer away E.N.E. keeping your Lead every hour at leaſt, until you come to 35 fathom, black peppery Sand, then you are right, and may boldly ſay, that you are ſome four leagues off the <hi>Berry;</hi> it bearing from you N.
